# Image Gallery

An image gallery navigated with the help of mouse or keys, built with vanilla JavaScript.

Things I learned while building this:

- How to have multiple instances of same things,
- How to govern the functionalities of different things, separately,
- How to control the whole UI with just keys,
- And, finally, how to put everything together!
